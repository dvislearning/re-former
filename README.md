# RE-FORMER

This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project's Ruby on [Rails Curriculum.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms)

Forms were created using three methods:
*  In a "non-railsy" way using old-fashioned HTML tags
*  Using the form_tag helper
*  Using the form_for helper

Forms contain basic validations and error messages are displayed in the view when records cannot be created or updated.
